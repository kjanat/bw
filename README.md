# Vaultwarden CLI

An independent TypeScript client built for Vaultwarden, with a reusable library
and a command-line frontend built on `@kjanat/dreamcli`.

- `packages/vaultwarden` — authentication, protocol, cryptography, vault management, generation, and transfers.
- `apps/cli` — the `vw` executable, encrypted local cache, and unlock sessions.
- `packages/typescript-config` — shared compiler settings.

Requires Node.js 24.8.0+.

```sh
vw --help
```

```sh
vw config server https://vault.example.com
export VW_SESSION="$(vw login you@example.com --raw)"
vw list items
vw lock
unset VW_SESSION
```

Development checks:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run format
```

Formatting uses the project's dprint configuration.

Run the managed disposable-server checks with Docker, OpenSSH and
`envctl` installed:

```sh
VW_TEST_BW=/absolute/path/to/bw bun run test:compat
VW_TEST_VERSION=1.36.0 bun run test:compat
```

The current-server comparison requires independent `bw` 2026.10.0. The older
server runs our protocol checks; that reference CLI cannot parse its prelogin
response. The runner uses immutable images, creates an ephemeral loopback server,
and removes it afterward. CI's planner combines the pinned baseline servers with
the latest stable Vaultwarden release, deduplicates versions, resolves any new
release to an image digest, and emits the JSON matrix for Node 24/26.

See the [usage guide](docs/README.md), [implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md),
and [Vaultwarden accommodations](docs/vaultwarden-deviations.md) for supported
commands, compatibility behavior, real-server tests, and outstanding work.
The implementation is in progress against the full CLI scope.
The [Vaultwarden accommodations inventory](docs/vaultwarden-deviations.md) explains
intentional differences from Bitwarden and the production rules that select them.

## Feature checklist

One checkbox represents one user-facing feature. [x] means implemented and
completely tested; [ ] means open or lacking complete tests. Import format
names follow the pinned [Bitwarden CLI inventory](docs/reference/bw-import-formats-2026.10.0.json).
Implementation details and known Vaultwarden differences are in
[implementation status](docs/implementation-status.md) and
[Vaultwarden accommodations](docs/vaultwarden-deviations.md).
